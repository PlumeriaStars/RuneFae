## A 2D Unity game demo including both a playable level and boss fight!

This project was created as my Senior Design Project. I wanted to do something that would allow me to both create code and art assets, and so this game demo came to be. Specifically, I created all the character, enemy, and boss sprites as well as wrote all the scripts. Other assets came from the Unity Asset Store and are linked at the bottom of the README. The game can be played from start to end despite the many bugs. For the most part, the initial commit of this project reflects the version of the game that was submitted in my final university semester. Recently, I have fixed some of the more obvious issues such as camera and sound issues in the boss level that prevented the player from beating the game in this updated version of the game.

<ins>Known Issues </ins>
- No End Screen: Finishing the game shows an image but doesn't actually give the players the option to restart or exit out
- Lack of Transitions: Changing between scenes is abrubt because no transitions have been implemented
- Unresponsive Shop: Attempting to open up the shop doesn't always work, you need to move the character around a bit and repeatedly press the open shop key
- No Upgrade Limits: There is no hardcap to health or speed upgrades so technically you could attempt to reach mach speed

__This demo has not been extremely tested and other miscellaneous issues can occur__
